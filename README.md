# Maternal to Zygotic Transition in Xenopus laevis is Regulated by miRNA Family 427

**Introduction** 

[Computational Genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_genomics) research at the University of Pittsburgh with [Dr. Miler Lee](https://www.biology.pitt.edu/person/miler-lee) and students to understand [Maternal-to-Zygotic transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_to_zygotic_transition) in [Xenopus laevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_clawed_frog). The project involved [Differential Gene Expression Analysis](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/functional-genomics-ii-common-technologies-and-data-analysis-methods/differential-gene) in R and prior file manipulation in Linux.
